# 615-final-project-JinzheZhang

Those files are used to EDA and analysis the data sets from Github and Kaggle.

I only made Shinyapp, HTML and RMD for the Githubjobs data set.

You can skip the Kaggle part(615-jobbigdata.rmd +jobsdata.json) which is used to test the reproducibility of code.


The aim of this project is to explore jobs and try to find the common vocabulary used in the job description.

Job type, company, title, location and description were analyzed below. For descriptions, texting manipulation was used to clean and dig the insight.

The data set which is from Github Job and, specifically jobs for software developers，data science.Linki is https://jobs.github.com/api. 

The larger data set whcih is from Kaggle and jobs are from Australia.https://www.kaggle.com/vipulanand/jobs-data.
